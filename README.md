# Jetpack-Compose-Bubble
A repository that shows floating bubble like Facebook message's chat bubble

Jetpack-Compose-Bubble is an innovative project designed to mimic the floating chat bubbles popularized by messenger apps like Facebook Messenger. Utilizing Jetpack Compose, this project provides an efficient, modern approach to implementing dynamic bubbling interfaces within Android applications.

## Modules Overview

This project is organized into three main modules: app, bubble, and bubblelayout. Each module plays a vital role in achieving the overall functionality and aesthetic appeal of the project.

### App Module

- **Purpose**: Serves as the main application module.
- **Responsibilities**: It integrates all other modules, manages the application lifecycle, and sets the foundation for UI navigation and interaction.
- **Features**: Handles the primary setup and configuration of the application, ensuring that all components communicate effectively.

### Bubble Module

- **Purpose**: Manages the core logic and behavior of the floating bubbles.
- **Responsibilities**: This module deals with the creation, interaction, and lifecycle management of the bubbles.
- **Features**: Provides a robust API for developers to instantiate, animate, and remove bubbles dynamically, focusing on functionality and responsiveness.

### BubbleLayout Module

- **Purpose**: Defines the design and layout parameters of the bubbles.
- **Responsibilities**: Contains Composable functions and layout definitions necessary for rendering visually appealing bubbles on the screen.
- **Features**: Ensures that bubbles are rendered consistently and adaptively across various devices and screen sizes, focusing on the aesthetic aspect of the bubbles.

By compartmentalizing the project into these distinct modules, Jetpack-Compose-Bubble fosters a streamlined development process, allowing each module to be developed, tested, and maintained separately. This modular structure not only enhances scalability but also simplifies integration and enhancement of functionalities.
